# K-bank-web

My most recent project was to create a bank login page and dashboard. The login system currently doesn't have any functionality to it which is subjected to change in the future.
K logo was made by using Canvas. Unfinished - plan on finishing the transaction/transfer page and mapping the to divs on the bank home page to be displayed. Also plan on adding settings where dark mode can be toggled and account details can be seen. I hope you enjoy :)
